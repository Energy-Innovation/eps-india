"These rows are intended to sum to less than one, as they are inputs as a share of gross output (e.g. ignoring value added)",,,,,,,,,
"These are shares of non-energy inputs, so we assign zeroes to all energy supplier cash flow entities.",,,,,,,,,
"Note: In India's case, the Nat gas & Petrol sys row sums up to slightly greater than 1. This is most likely due to the difference",,,,,,,,,
"in classification of the industries in the KLEMS database, from which the input shares are sourced (KLEMS database",,,,,,,,,
also includes nuclear and coke in the classification). We hence adjust for this by assuming only 80% of each of the shares derived ,,,,,,,,,
from KLEMS in the Nat Gas and Petroleum Systems category.,,,,,,,,,
